When developing an application which is larger than a demo, its useful to have a better structure.

This series is about presenting a better project-based structure.

# Part 2:
Building on ideas described in Part1.
 - Pyodide (full python) or Micropython
 - "Loading" animation

## Initial user interaction
We are now using the Ltk for Dom manipulation and all screen UI.
Ltk has jQuery base, so can also use that approach for Selectors and dom manipulation

## Terminal
The Ltk allows us to move the terminal into a sliding section.
This means we can minimise the terminal on-screen while still having full access.
